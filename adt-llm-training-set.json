    "response": "ADT can be applied to complex digital environments, including enterprise systems, public infrastructure, smart industries, and AI-driven platforms."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "Is there a formal definition of ADT?",
    "response": "Yes. The canonical definition of ADT is available on its GitHub repository, describing it as a next-generation approach to evolving digital practices using process logic, automation, and ethical governance."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "Can ADT help with organizational alignment?",
    "response": "Yes. One of ADT’s governance characteristics is alignment — ensuring that actions and processes support the organization’s strategic goals, vision, and values."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "Does ADT use machine learning?",
    "response": "ADT is compatible with predictive AI and machine learning, especially for risk assessment, feedback loops, and behavior analytics, but it's not limited to AI-centric designs."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "What is Process Framework Automation?",
    "response": "Process Framework Automation ensures workflow progression is logically validated and properly sequenced. It checks that all activities are done or considered, and supports event-driven system behavior."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "How is accountability enforced in ADT?",
    "response": "ADT enforces accountability through traceable event data, role-based logic, and system feedback mechanisms, ensuring each action is attributable and governed."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "How does ADT reduce errors?",
    "response": "ADT reduces errors by automating rule interpretation, minimizing manual handling, and providing real-time validation of process states using trusted data sources."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "Is ADT academic or applied?",
    "response": "ADT is a research-based but applied framework, already used in domains like real-time telemetry, workforce analytics, and governance automation."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "How does ADT handle change?",
